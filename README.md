# Web Automation Framework - Selenium Java TestNG

Welcome to the **Web Automation Framework** project! This is a demo project built using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, and **TestNG**, showcasing automation skills with data-driven testing and robust framework design. The project is a work in progress, with ongoing improvements, additional test cases, and utility files being added over time.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Supports external data sources (Excel) to test a variety of input data combinations.
- **Reusable Utility Functions:** Includes helper methods for common automation tasks like handling alerts, dropdowns, waits, etc.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Organizes test code into modular, maintainable components.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Supports execution on Chrome, Firefox, and other major browsers.
- **TestNG Integration:** Enables parallel execution, custom reporting, and flexible test configuration.
- **Extensible Framework:** Designed to scale by adding new test cases and utility methods effortlessly.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install [Java JDK 11+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
3. Set up an IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).
4. Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and/or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

### **Dependencies**
The project uses the following libraries:
- **Selenium WebDriver:** For browser automation
- **TestNG:** For test configuration and reporting
- **Apache POI:** For reading/writing Excel files (data-driven testing)
- **Log4j:** For logging test execution steps (optional)

Dependencies are managed in the `pom.xml` file via Maven.

3.Run the following command to download the required dependencies:

      mvn clean install

4. Execute all tests using Maven:

      ```bash
       mvn test
   
5.Reports : TestNG generates reports in the test-output directory. Open index.html in your browser to view detailed test execution results.


**Future Enhancements**
Adding More Test Cases: Expanding test coverage for various scenarios.
Utility Enhancements: Adding reusable methods like screenshot capture, API utilities, etc.
Reporting: Integration with advanced reporting tools like ChainTest LP framework.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automating test execution with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
